                  <p>A Jobless man applied for the position of 'office boy' at Microsoft. The HR <br>manager interviewed him then watched him cleaning the floor as a test. <br>一个失业的人去微软申请办公室文员的职位，人事经理面试他，并且看着他打扫地 <br>板，作为测试。&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'You are employed' he said.&nbsp; Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you <br>the application to fill in, as well as date when&nbsp; you may start. <br>‘你被录用了’人事经理说：给我你的邮箱地址，我会把申请表发给你填，发给你的同 <br>时也意味着你开始上班&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The man replied 'But I don't have a computer, neither an email'. <br>这个人回答说：但是我没有电脑，更没有邮箱了&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'I'm sorry', said the HR manager. If you don't have an email, that means <br>you do not exist. And who doesn't exist, cannot have the job.' <br>我很抱歉，人事经理说：如果你没有邮箱，那就意味着你不能生存，一个不能生存的 <br>人当然不能有工作。&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The man left with no hope at all. He didn't know what to do, with only $10 <br>in his pocket. He then decided to go to the supermarket and buy a 10Kg <br>tomato crate. <br>这个人不抱希望的离开了，他不知道要做什么，口袋里只有10块钱，他决定去超市买 <br>了10公斤西红柿。&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He then sold the tomatoes in a door to door round. In less than two hours, <br>he succeeded to double his capital. He repeated the operation three times, <br>and returned home with $60. <br>接着他在附近门挨着门卖西红柿，不到两小时，他成功的将他的资金翻了一倍，他又 <br>做了3个小时，到回家时身上已经有60块钱了。&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; The man realized that he can survive by this way, and started to go <br>everyday earlier, and return late. Thus, his money doubled or tripled <br>everyday. <br>这个人认识到他可以用这种方式生存，以后他每天起的很早，回家的很晚，因此，他 <br>的钱每天都翻两三倍。&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Shortly, he bought a cart, then a truck, and then he had his own fleet of <br>delivery vehicles. <br>很短的时间里，他买了? 鍪滞瞥担?缓罂ǔ担?幼潘?辛俗约旱脑耸涑刀印?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>5 years later, the man is one of the biggest food retailers in the US .. <br>5年以后，他成了美国最大的食品零售商.......&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He started to plan his family's future, and decided to have a life <br>insurance. <br>他开始计划他家庭的未来，就决定买个人身保险&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He called an insurance broker, and chose a protection plan. <br>他打电话给保险经济人，然后选择一个保险&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>When the conversation was concluded the broker asked him his email. <br>The man replied, 'I don't have an email.'The broker answered curiously, <br>'You don't have an email, and yet have succeeded to build an empire.<br>Can you imagine what you could have been if you had an e mail?!!' <br>The man thought for a while and replied, 'Yes, I'd be an office boy at Microsoft!' <br>当谈话结束后保险经济人问他的邮箱地址，他说：我没有邮箱. 保险经济人很吃惊的说：<br>你没有邮箱都可以成功的建立一个帝国，你能想象如果你有邮箱的话会怎么样吗？<br>这个人想了一下然后回答：是的，我会成为微软的办公室文员&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Moral of the story <br>故事寓意&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Moral 1&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Internet is not the solution to your life. <br>网络不是你生活的解决办法&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Moral 2&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; If you don't have Internet, and work hard, you can be a millionaire. <br>如果你没有网络，但是努力工作，你仍可以成为百万富翁 <br>&nbsp; <br>Moral 3&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you received this message by email, <br>you are closer to being a office boy/girl,than a millionaire.......... <br>如果你收到了这封邮件，表示你离办公室文员很近了，而不是百万富翁...... <br>&nbsp; <br>P.S - Do not forward this email back to me, <br>I am closing my email account &amp; going to sell tomatoes!!! <br>另外，各位不要把这封邮件再回复给我，因为我已经关了邮箱去卖西红柿了</p>
